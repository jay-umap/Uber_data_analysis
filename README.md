# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Uber Ride Data project

This project provides insights into Uber ride data through detailed analysis and visualizations using Python. The dataset used for this project has been uploaded alongside the project files for reference.

## Project Details

### Project Goals:
- Perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualize key findings for better understanding and presentation.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

### Dataset:
The dataset contains Uber ride details, including timestamps, ride locations, and more. This dataset is uploaded as part of the project for your reference.

### Key Analysis Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and filtering unnecessary data.
2. **EDA**:
   - Distribution of rides over different time periods.
   - Trends in ride frequency by location and time.
   - Identification of peak hours and busy locations.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Time series analysis.
   - Geographic analysis using heatmaps.
   - Bar and pie charts to represent categorical insights.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8 or above).
3. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the `Uber_Data_Analysis_using_py.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
5. Run the cells step by step to execute the analysis.

## Output
The project provides meaningful visualizations and insights into Uber ride patterns. These outputs can help understand user behavior and operational trends.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include predictive modeling.
- Incorporate more recent or diverse datasets for broader insights.
